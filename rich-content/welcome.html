<h2 class="font_2" style="text-align: center">Welcome to my demo website!</h2>
<p class="font_8">This &nbsp;website was created for various tests using the Wix tools, and for hosting demonstrations of concepts and how to achieve them on Wix.</p>
<p class="font_8"><br></p>
<p class="font_7"><strong>Therefore, stuff may break often, </strong>but usually only stable versions are released.</p>
<p class="font_8">I am pretty active on the <a href="https://forum.wixstudio.com/u/deanayalon/summary"><u>Wix Forums</u></a> so this site is likely to expand as I help users solve issues.</p>
<p class="font_8"><br></p>
<p class="font_8">The site uses the GitHub integration, and is published automatically using GitHub Actions</p>
